## Introduction

Are you an independent doctor looking for a simple yet powerful way to manage patient information? Do you find existing clinic management systems too complex or cumbersome for your daily needs? Or perhaps you just want a lightweight, privacy-focused tool that keeps your patients’ records right at your fingertips?

**HealthNote** is your all-in-one, command-line solution for seamless patient management - designed specifically for doctors who value speed, control, and simplicity.

With **HealthNote**, you can easily:
- **Add** new patients and record key details such as contact information, medical history, and allergies
- **View** a patient’s medical information in seconds
- **Find** patients by name or specific keywords
- **Delete** outdated records when necessary
- …and do much more - all directly from your terminal!

Built with independent practitioners and small clinics in mind, **HealthNote** keeps your workflow efficient and focused. Whether you’re managing a handful of patients or maintaining a growing list, this CLI-based address book gives you the precision and speed you need - without unnecessary clutter.

HealthNote is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HealthNote can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## User Interface

Here are the key components of the HealthNote User Interface (UI), designed for the convenience of our users.

*insert the UI photo here this is just a placeholder for now with labels for the components*

| No | Component        | Description                                                                            |
|----|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Command Input    | This is where the user inputs commands to perform various tasks.                       |
| 2  | Command Result   | Displays the output and the result of performing a command.                            |
| 3  | Patient List     | Displays the list of patients.                                                         |
| 4  | View Patient     | Displays all the data fields of patients which the user requests to view.              |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HealthNote.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui-Updated.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

### Command Format
<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\friend` or as `n\John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\friend`, `t\friend t\family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

### Input Constraints Table

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**Caution:**

* The symbol is `\` is reserved as a command delimiter. While it is not explicitly prohibited in command values, it is
  highly discouraged as it could cause unexpected behaviour.

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, HealthNote will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the HealthNote to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will be focused, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
